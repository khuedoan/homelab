# External resources

**WIP documents**

> These resources are optional, the homelab still works without them but will lack some features like trusted certificates and offsite backup

Although I try to keep the amount of external resources to the minimum, there's still need for a few of them.
Below is a list of external resources and why we need them (also see some [alternatives](#alternatives) below).

- Terraform Cloud:
  - Workspace to store the state for external resources
- Cloudflare:
  - DNS
  - DNS-01 challenge for Let's Encrypt
  - Tunnel to public services to the internet without port-forwarding
- Backblaze:
  - B2 storage with S3 compatible API for offsite backup

This layer will:

- Create external resources
- Add external secrets to namespaces

## Prerequisites

### Create Terraform workspace

TODO

### Create Cloudflare API token

<https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens>

Terraform API token summary:

```
This API token will affect the below accounts and zones, along with their respective permissions

└── Khue Doan - Argo Tunnel:Edit, Account Settings:Read
    └── khuedoan.com - Zone:Read, DNS:Edit

Client IP Address Filtering

└── Is in - 117.xxx.xxx.xxx, 2402:xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx
```

### Create Backblaze API key

<https://secure.backblaze.com/app_keys.htm>

```
Name of Key: Homelab
Allow access to Bucket(s): All
Type of Access: Read and Write
```

## Deploy

Apply Terraform (you will be prompted to login to Terraform Cloud and enter API keys from the previous steps):

```sh
make
```

Note: If you are using Terraform Cloud, ensure you set "Execution Mode" as "Local" in your workspace settings as Terraform Cloud won't be able to access your homelab cluster.

## Alternatives

- Terraform Cloud: any other [Terraform backends](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends)
- Cloudflare Tunnel: you can build a small VPS in the cloud and route traffic via it using Wireguard and HAProxy. 
- Backblaze B2: any S3 compatible object storage, such as S3 Glacier, Minio...
