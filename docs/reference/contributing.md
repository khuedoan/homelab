### Documentation

Documents can be viewed at <https://homelab.khuedoan.com>.
It's running on my other cluster in the [khuedoan/horus](https://github.com/khuedoan/horus) project
(so if the homelab goes down I can still read the documentation).

To edit and view locally, run:

```
make docs
```

Then visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
