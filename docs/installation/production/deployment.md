# Deployment

Open the tools container, which includes all the tools needed:

```sh
make tools
```

Build the lab:

```sh
make
```

!!! note

     It will take a while to download Rocky Linux ISO on the first time

Yes it's that simple!

You can read the [architecture document](../../reference/architecture.md) while waiting for the deployment to complete.
