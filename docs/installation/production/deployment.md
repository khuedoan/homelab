# Deployment

Open the tools container if you haven't already:

```sh
make tools
```

Build the lab:

```sh
make
```

Yes it's that simple!

!!! example

    <script id="asciicast-xkBRkwC6e9RAzVuMDXH3nGHp7" src="https://asciinema.org/a/xkBRkwC6e9RAzVuMDXH3nGHp7.js" async></script>

It will take a while to download everything,
you can read the [architecture document](../../architecture/overview.md) while waiting for the deployment to complete.
