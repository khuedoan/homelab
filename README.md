This project utilizes [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) and [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops) to automate provisioning, operating, and updating self-hosted services in my homelab.
It can be used as a highly customizable framework to build your own homelab.

> **What is a homelab?**
>
> Homelab is a laboratory at home where you can self-host, experiment with new technologies, practice for certifications, and so on.
> For more information about homelab in general, see the [r/homelab introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction).
